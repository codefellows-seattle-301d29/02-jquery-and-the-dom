# Kilovolt Blog

**Author**: Taylor & Dave
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
This is a blog that includes random awesome ipsum articles. It's basically the general format of a blog where we can post an arbitrary number of articles, which we can add by just putting a new object that includes article values into an array. These object properties will eventually assigned by grabbing data from a database - which in turn gets its data from forms.

## Getting Started
Copy the source code into a directory of your choice, install node.js and npm on your computer, install the live-server package, and then start the live-server inside the chosen directory.

## Architecture
This app uses HTML5, CSS following SMACCS best practices, ES6 JavaScript, and jQuery version 3.2.1.

## Change Log

## Credits and Collaborators
