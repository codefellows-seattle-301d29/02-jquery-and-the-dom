#### Single-line Summary
**Today, Alex and I (Christian) paired together. It took about 4 hours.**

#### Reflect and summarize on your process for each `TODO` item :  
  1. First, we looked over the code and added high level comments about what each piece of code would be accomplishing. 
  2. Next, we took data from rawData (array of objects) and passed it into the article constructor to instantiate objects. 
  3. Next, we cloned the article template, and removed the 'template' class on $newArticle. Along with this, we used Jquery to find elements and set data from the articles to fill the page.
  4. Finally, we fixed up some small stuff with the styling and refactored the for loops to a forEach() function.
