#### Single-line Summary
**Today, Keith and Melanie paired together. It took about 3.5-4 hours**

#### Reflect and summarize on your process for each `TODO` item :  
  1. First, we copied over CSS files from yesterday's lab in order to keep styling consistent.
  2. Then, we started on the HTML document and added comments and script tags where appropriate.
  3. Next, we moved to the blogArticles.js file and addressed the comment section there.
  4. Next, we worked on the article.js file. We built a constructor function, the toHtml() function, reviewed the review items, and updated the loops.
