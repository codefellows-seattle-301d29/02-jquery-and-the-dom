## User Stories and Feature Tasks

- Continue styling the app using SMACSS practices. Take a few minutes for code review of your partner's CSS and decide how to incorporate it into your paired lab. You can choose one partner's CSS structure, or you can combine them as you see fit. Seek to optimize and organize your CSS as much as possible!

*As a user, I want my site to display my blog articles in a clear, logical way so that I can find the most recent articles first and the blog is easy to read.*

- Complete the `toHtml()` method, which will ultimately be used to render each article instance to the DOM.
- The articles should be sorted by date.

*As a developer, I want to make my code DRY and render articles from a separate data file so that my HTML file is not cluttered with lengthy and repetitive code.*

- Complete the `Article()` constructor and create instances by assigning all of the properties of each data object to properties of `this`.

*As a developer, I want to utilize the jQuery library's functionality so that I can efficiently access, traverse, and manipulate elements on the DOM.*

- Add the necessary script tag to include jQuery in the app.
- Utilize jQuery functionality to modify the display property of DOM elements.
- Utilize jQuery functionality to traverse the DOM and complete the HTML template for the articles.

*As a developer, I want to optimize iteration with JavaScript array methods so that my code is more condensed and maintainable.*

- Refactor all `for` loops using the `.forEach()` method.



# 02-jquery-and-the-dom

**Author**: Keith & Melanie
**Version**: 1.0.0

We used javaScript to build an object constructor to instantiate objects from a data array.  Using these objects and jQuery we populated the HTML with blog-like entries.  This is the first assignment to use jQuery to manipulate the DOM.

## Getting Started
Use provided source files in addition to the stylesheets from the previous day assignment.

## Architecture
Use of JavaScript and jQuery.

## Change Log
First release. No changes from previous version.
