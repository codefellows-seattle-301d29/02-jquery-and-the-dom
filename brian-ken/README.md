# Project Name: jQuery & the Dom

**Author**: Brian Bixby & Ken Unterseher
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
This assignment was a good opportunity to render data from a seperate data file using JQuery to access, tranverse, and manipulate DOM elements.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
The user must create a seperate data file of blog posts. From here they woud create a template in HTML. Next they would create a constructor function in JQuery that will build these objects and push them into an array. From here they would utilize JQuery to insert the key value pairs into the HTML.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
Git for version control. HTML as a template for the document. CSS to style the document. JQuery to access, traverse, and manipulate the DOM.
