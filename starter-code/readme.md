## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

We are configuring a prebuilt site to sort the articles by days ago and make it more organized and a neater appearance. 

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

Created a constuctor function. Plugged in the data required in the index.html. Added necessary css.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
jQuery, JavaScript, CSS, HTML.

## Change Log

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with GET and POST routes for the book resource. -->

01-10-2018 - Application is now functional and sorted by date which is days ago.

## Credits and Collaborations

I worked on this alone and used notes from the previous class to accomplish.
